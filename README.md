# Compiler for imperative language IFJ18

The compiler reads the code in the IF18 language and translates it into a IFJcode18 three-address byte code.

This program was created as a semester project of the IFJ course at the VUT FIT. For more detailed information on IFJ18, IFJcode18 and the project task, check out the `ifj2018.pdf` file.
